                        competition, this cup was donated in January 2005 in memory 
                        of David Cassidy. David was a regular and enthusiastic climber 
                        at alien rock from the third day of opening in 1994 until his
                        death in a climbing accident at Dunkeld on 9th July 2004. 
                        He had often entered the Veterans competition and it was for this reason 
                        that his colleagues at the Scottish Executive donated the cup.</p>

                        It was first presented to the top woman in 2006 after being donated by family and friends of Susie Carmichael, a former 
                        regular competitor. A keen all round climber, Susie was well known at alien 
                        rock for her enthusiasm and sense of adventure and made many friends. 
                        She died after a solo winter mountaineering accident in the Highlands.</p>
